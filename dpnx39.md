## Interest of content
Rating: Excellent


Comment: Was an interesting read.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Rating: Sound   


Comment: There is a Consistency within the visual presentation of each web page however the styling used is very basic. Would be better to include some more styling options such as changing the layout, colour or adding images.
## Quality of written presentation
Rating: Very Good


Comment: There was a lack of sub headings used within the website. It was used within the education page but that is all. Would make information easier to read if sub headings showed what the paragraphs were about.
Good use of references and the line which split the contents of the page from navigation bar, content and author information.

## Validity of HTML
Rating: Excellent

Comment: Within the automation.html file, you could have used the <br> tags to create new paragraphs instead of using multiple <p> tags but this is fine. I think there was supposed to be links to the paragraphs within the medical page using the list but none was given.
## Evidence of collaboration including  
Rating: Excellent
### Is the author info written by another author?
Comment: The author information was written by a different author for each page. This was done by looking through the commits. The original author's GitHub pages and/or LinkedIn pages were linked.

### Balanced contribution from members
Comment: From the commits it seems as though there was a balanced contribution. Harder to see since some made more commits than others but the changes differed in size.
### Was it completed at the last minute?
Comment: Looking at the commits, the work was spread cross the week.
