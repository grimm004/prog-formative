	<h3><b>How Is Computing Used In These Cases</b></h3>
	<p>
	Medical Informatics is defined as the discipline which is the study, invention and
	implementation of structures and algorithms to improve communication, understanding and managment
	of medical information. This is a multidiscplinary field but the main aim is to promote new technolgies
	which will improve the standard of healthcare around the globe.
	</p>
	<p>
	Health Informatics	tackles the problem of access to healthcare information. It attempts to optimise the
	acquisition of information in the fields of healthcare and biomedicine. This discipline makes use of IT
	applications to develop algorithms which collect, store and analyse data in digitial formats.
	</p>
	<p>
	Biomedical Informatics is the science of information as applied to or studied in the context of
	patho-physiological processes with methods from biology, chemistry and physics. This discipline
	pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry,
	problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.
	</p>
	<p>
	Pharmacy Informatics is the field field that focuses on medication-related data and knowledge within
	the field of healthcare systems impacting on patient care and management. This discipline has created inventions
	such as Intelligent pills that can deliver targeted drug therapy to specific areas of the body, monitor the bodyâ€™s
	environment (e.g. pH levels, temperature), and otherwise support informatics efforts by transmitting data via wireless
	technology. Other pharmacy technologies like mobile apps, sensors on medication caps, and skin patches can also gather
	patient information send it out to their care team via the cloud.
	</p>
	<p>
	Cheminformatics requires use of computer and informational techniques, applied to a range of problems in the field of
	chemistry; more relevantly in the drug discovery process in the healthcare field. Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those
	information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making
	better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization. Cheminformatics combines the scientific
	working fields of chemistry, computer science and information science for example in the areas of topology, chemical graph
	theory, information retrieval and data mining in the chemical space. Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis
	for various industries like paper and pulp, dyes and such allied industries.</p>
