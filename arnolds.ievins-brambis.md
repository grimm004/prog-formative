I.      Interest of content
    The content in the medical and automation pages is good and views the fields in question in an objective manner,
    however the education and even more so the internet pages are rather one sided and only emphasize the good in the 
    respective fields.
        Overall rating - Good
II.     Consistency and quality of visual presentation
    The visual presentation is very consistent and easy to read and view, however the styling is overly minimalised 
    to the point of being similar to a word document. The landing page is just another copy of the same layout, but includes 
    a rather large whitespace and feels like it is only there so that the site would have a landing page.
        Overall rating - Sound
III.    Quality of written presentation 
    The writing is good in terms of discribing the appropriate field, however it can be hard to read at times due to
    large chunks of text and frequent use of very subject specific terms. Some of the content is also biased as mentioned
    previously. There is also a spelling error in the second to last paragraph of the automation page.
        Overall rating - Acceptable
IV.     Validity of HTML
    The html code is very easy to read and funtions well.
        Overall rating - Excellent
V.      Evidence of collaboration
    The contributions from all members are balanced and the website was finished in a timely manner.
        Overall rating - Outstanding
